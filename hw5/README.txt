(a) Best-fit values for the parameters:
	a = -9.95518358 
	b = -0.25296471  
	c = 9.04084545

(b) Average Temperature (Celsius):  8.93322210467
	Coldest Day (Celsius):  -0.91420938926
	Hottest Day (Celsius):  18.9958696591

(c) The b parameter shifts the fit left or right accordingly. This is necessary since the data is not a uniform sine function, instead the temperatures are offset by a certain phase shift. The first peak in temperature is not at x=0.

(b) Neither? Linear and Quadratic fit mostly similar lines to the data. Although the data does not show much of a trend that can be fitted.
